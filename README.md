# Onco_miner
This perl program is a stand alone miner. As an input it is using .csv files from oncomine.org. Oncomine.org is taking a list of genes and it returns how the expression change in a particular cancer. So if you have a list of 200 genes and 20 different types of cancer, you will end up with 20 different .csv files with 200 gene each. This program will help you to combine all this data. It can give you for example the best 20 genes with the bigger fold change in all cancers. It returns also a world cloud with the gene names.
