# Onco_miner
This perl program is a stand alone miner. As an input it is using .csv files from oncomine.org. Oncomine.org is taking a list of genes that you are interested and it is returning how the expression of these genes are changing in a particular cancer. So if you have a list of 200 genes and 20 different types of cancer you will end up with 20 different .csv files with 200 gene each. This program is helping to combine all this data. It can give you for example the best 20 genes with the bigger fold change in all cancers. It returns also a world cloud with the gene names.
